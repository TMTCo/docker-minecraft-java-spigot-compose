# docker-minecraft-java-spigot-compose


all that there is for the user is to git clone this repository into ubuntu server or any server distro using linux.

I reccomend going to root or superuser by entering sudo su -
into the ssh prompt

than in which ever directory you cloned the repo to type cd docker-minecraft-java-spigot-compose to go to the cloned directory

than just run docker-compose up -d but it only works if you clone and run as superuser/root

Your output should look like this
